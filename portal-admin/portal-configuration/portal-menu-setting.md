# Portal Menu Setting

The practice's Patient Portal administrator uses Feature Settings to enable or disable the Portal's features. Since many of these features apply practice-wide, the practice’s Portal administrator normally sets them prior to establishing the remaining settings from the menu, even though the Feature Settings choice comes at the end of the menu.

The system displays the Activate/Deactive Features as shown below:
