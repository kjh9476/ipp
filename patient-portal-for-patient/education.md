# Education

The Patient Portal menu allows the patient to view any educational material that has been published to his/her portal. Diagnoses and treatment plans can be difficult for patients to understand and remember. In order to reinforce this information, practices have been giving patients supplemental printed materials for years. And now, with a portal, patients can access these materials online.
